# Personal Development Preferences

## System Environment
- OS: macOS
- Shell: fish
- Editor: VS Code

## Code Style
- Adapt to existing project style. If no project:
  - Best practices
  - JS/TS: ES modules
  - PHP: 8.2+

## Development Workflow
- Never modify working code without explicit permission

## Tools & Commands
- Always check if dependencies are already installed before installing

## Communication Style
- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous

## Do Not Touch
- Don't change dependency versions without discussion
- Don't refactor working legacy code unless explicitly requested
